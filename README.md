# gameboy_image_demo
A demo using GBDK 2020 that shows a picture of a dog and plays some sound. 

Currently is able to run on the Super Gameboy using the [bgb emulator](https://bgb.bircd.org/#downloads).
To run it, all you need is the actual ROM file (picture.gb) and use whatever GameBoy emulator that supports Super Gameboy emulation.
